# Blog App

This is a simple blog app that allows users to create/read/update/delete their posts.

# Requirements

- node: v22.10.0

# Why am I building this?

I want to learn how to use **Pinia** for state management and **Supabase** for storing the posts created by the users. In the future, maybe I'll add login function using also Supabase.
