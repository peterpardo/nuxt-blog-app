# Blog App

This is a simple blog app that allows users to create/read/update/delete their posts. **Update:** Already deleted the database for this project. Doing CRUD functionalities will not work for now.

# Requirements

- node: v22.10.0

# Why am I building this?

I want to learn how to use **Pinia** for state management and **Supabase** for storing the posts created by the users. In the future, maybe I'll add login function using also Supabase.

# Technologies used
- Vue.js/Nuxt
- Supabase - database and authentication
- Prisma - ORM
- Pinia - Vue.js state management
- NuxtUI - Compenent Library

# Short Demo
